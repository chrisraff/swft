### Description
Spire With Fewer Tears is a tool intended for use by students where Spire is used for registration in courses. SWFT allows you to turn your class schedule into a simple calendar image as opposed to the atrocious "Weekly Calendar View" that Spire presents. SWFT also allows you to turn your calendar into iCalendar events so you can effortlessly add them to your calendar.

### Instructions
1. Go to Spire and log in. From the main page, click "weekly schedule" (found directly under "This Week's Schedule").
2. Admire how egregious the presentation of the schedule is.
3. Choose the "List View" radio button above the calendar view. Select the appropriate term if needed.
4. Highlight the list of classes. Start with the name of the first class (SUBJECT ###) and end with the very end of the last class. Copy this to your clipboard (Ctrl + C).
5. Create a file in the SWFT folder and paste the schedule into that file.
6. Run SWFT.java from the command line or from eclipse. You can indicate the file that contains your pasted schedule as an argument when running the program. If you do not do this, the program will prompt you for the filename.
7. The output image and iCalendar file will be found in the SWFT folder. You can email the ics file to yourself if you wish to add it to a number of calendars. Most phones and devices should be able to read this type of file.
